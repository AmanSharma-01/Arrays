// Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. 
//The stalls are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

// His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other 
//once put into a stall. To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, 
//such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. 
//What is the largest minimum distance?

// Input
// t â€“ the number of test cases, then t test cases follows.
// * Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C
// * Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains an integer stall location, xi

// Output
// For each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance.
